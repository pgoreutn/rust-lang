# Common Collections

Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called collections. 
Unlike the built-in array and tuple types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or shrink as the program runs.
We’ll discuss three collections that are used very often in Rust:
* vector allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
* string is a collection of characters.
* hash map allows you to associate a value with a particular key.

## Storing lists of values with vectors

Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that puts all the values next to each other in memory. 

### Creating a New Vector

To create a new, empty vector, we can call the Vec::new function

```Rust
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
```

In more realistic code, Rust can often infer the type of value you want to store once you insert values, so you rarely need to do this type annotation. 
Rust provides the vec! macro for convenience. The macro will create a new vector that holds the values you give it.
creates a new Vec<i32> that holds the values 1, 2, and 3.

```Rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
```
Because we’ve given initial i32 values, Rust can infer that the type of v is Vec<i32>, and the type annotation isn’t necessary.

### Updating a Vector

To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the push method
```Rust
let mut v = Vec::new();

v.push(5);
v.push(6);
v.push(7);
v.push(8);
```

```
As with any variable, if we want to be able to change its value, we need to make it mutable
```

### Reading Elements of Vectors

There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector.

```Rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let third: &i32 = &v[2];
println!("The third element is {}", third);

match v.get(2) {
   Some(third) => println!("The third element is {}", third),
   None => println!("There is no third element."),
}
```

First, we use the index value of 2 to get the third element: vectors are indexed by number, starting at zero. Second, the two ways to get the third element are by using & and [], which gives us a reference, or by using the get method with the index passed as an argument, which gives us an Option<&T>.

```Rust
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let does_not_exist = &v[100];
let does_not_exist = v.get(100);
```

When we run this code, the first [] method will cause the program to panic because it references a nonexistent element. 
When the get method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it returns None without panicking.

```
    Recall the rule that states you can’t have mutable and immutable references in the same scope.
    Where we hold an immutable reference to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the end, which won't work.

```

```Rust
let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

let first = &v[0];

v.push(6);

println!("The first element is: {}", first);
```

```
error[E0502]: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
 --> src/main.rs:6:5
  |
4 |     let first = &v[0];
  |                  - immutable borrow occurs here
5 |
6 |     v.push(6);
  |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
7 |
8 |     println!("The first element is: {}", first);
|                                             ----- immutable borrow later used here
```

## Iterating over the Values in a Vector

If we want to access each element in a vector ,  we can iterate through all of the elements rather than use indices to access one at a time.  We have to use a for loop to get immutable references to each element in a vector of i32 values and print them.

``Rust
let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &v {
    println!("{}", i);
}
```

We can also iterate over mutable references to each element in a mutable vector in order to make changes to all the elements. 

```Rust
let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
for i in &mut v {
    *i += 50;
}
```

To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the dereference operator (*) to get to the value in i before we can use the += operator. 

## What Is a String?

Rust has only one string type in the core language, which is the string slice str that is usually seen in its borrowed form &str. 
The String type, which is provided by Rust’s standard library rather than coded into the core language, is a growable,mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded string type.


### Creating a New String

Many of the same operations available with Vec<T> are available with String as well, starting with the new function to create a string

```Rust
let mut s = String::new();
```

This line creates a new, empty string called s , often, we’ll have some initial data that we want to start the string with.

```Rust
let data = "initial contents";

let s = data.to_string();

// the method also works on a literal directly:
let s = "initial contents".to_string();

```

We can also use the function String::from to create a String from a string literal. The code is equivalent to the code that uses to_string.

```Rust
let s = String::from("initial contents");
```

### Updating a String

A String can grow in size and its contents can change, just like the contents of a Vec<T>, if you push more data into it. In addition, you can conveniently use the + operator or the format! macro to concatenate String values.

#### Appending to a String with push_str and push

We can grow a String by using the push_str method to append a string slice

```Rust
let mut s = String::from("foo");
s.push_str("bar");
```

#### Concatenation with the + Operator or the format! Macro

```Rust
let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
```

## Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps

The last of our common collections is the hash map. The type HashMap<K, V> stores a mapping of keys of type K to values of type V. 

Hash maps are useful when you want to look up data not by using an index, as you can with vectors, but by using a key that can be of any type. 

### Creating a New Hash Map

You can create an empty hash map with new and add elements with insert. We’re keeping track of the scores of two teams whose names are Blue and Yellow. 

```Rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
```

### Hash Maps and Ownership

For types that implement the Copy trait, such as i32, the values are copied into the hash map. For owned values such as String, the values will be moved and the hash map will be the owner of those values

```Rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
let field_value = String::from("Blue");

let mut map = HashMap::new();
map.insert(field_name, field_value);
// field_name and field_value are invalid at this point, try using them and
// see what compiler error you get!
```

### Accessing Values in a Hash Map

We can get a value out of the hash map by providing its key to the get method

```Rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);

let team_name = String::from("Blue");
let score = scores.get(&team_name);
```

The result is wrapped in Some because get returns an Option<&V>; if there’s no value for that key in the hash map, get will return None. 

We can iterate over each key/value pair in a hash map in a similar manner as we do with vectors, using a for loop:

```Rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
for (key, value) in &scores {
    println!("{}: {}", key, value);
}
```

### Updating a Hash Map

When you want to change the data in a hash map, you have to decide how to handle the case when a key already has a value assigned. You could replace the old value with the new value, completely disregarding the old value. 

#### Overwriting a Value

If we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key with a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced. 

```Rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();

scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

#### Only Inserting a Value If the Key Has No Value
It’s common to check whether a particular key has a value and, if it doesn’t, insert a value for it.
Hash maps have a special API for this called entry that takes the key you want to check as a parameter. The return value of the entry method is an enum called Entry that represents a value that might or might not exist. 

```Rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let mut scores = HashMap::new();
scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);

scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);

println!("{:?}", scores);
```

The or_insert method on Entry is defined to return a mutable reference to the value for the corresponding Entry key if that key exists, and if not, inserts the parameter as the new value for this key and returns a mutable reference to the new value.

#### Updating a Value Based on the Old Value

Another common use case for hash maps is to look up a key’s value and then update it based on the old value. 

```Rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

let text = "hello world wonderful world";

let mut map = HashMap::new();

for word in text.split_whitespace() {
    let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
    *count += 1;
}

println!("{:?}", map);
```
