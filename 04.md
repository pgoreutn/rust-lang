# Rust Module Essentials
Understanding Rust's modules comes from understanding the keywords mod, pub, and use. To state them simply:

* **mod** declares a module.
* **pub** exposes.
* **use** pulls things in.

Let's begin with an example. Modules can be defined two ways.

 First in place:
```rust
// main.rs

mod food {
    pub fn eat() {
        println!("Good.");
    }
}
fn main() {
    food::eat();
}
```

Second, as a separate file:

```rust
// main.rs

mod food;

fn main() {
    food::eat();
}

// food.rs or food/mod.rs

pub fn eat() {
    println!("Yum.");
}
```
mod X means: let there be a module X, defined either here, in braces, or in a separate file named X.rs or X/mod.rs

pub fn eat makes eat visible to main. Without pub, main would not be able to call eat.
Note that without mod food in main, Rust would ignore food.rs entirely.

### Single Module
If you have want to have a module in single file, well its pretty simple.
* single_module.rs

```rust
pub fn foo() {
 println!("Im in single module");
}
```

* main.rs

```rust
mod single_module;

fn main() {
 single_module::foo();
}
```

Notice that single_module has been declared in main.rs unlike some other languages where we import them.

### Sub modules
This is a little different in Rust. My file hierarchy is

```
.
|-- sub module
|    |--mod.rs
|    |--mod1.rs
|    |--mod2.rs
`-- main.rs
```

Note that the mod.rs here is necessary.

* main.rs
```rust
mod sub_modules;

fn main() {
  sub_modules::mod1::foo();
  sub_modules::mod2::foo();
}
```
* sub_modules/mod.rs
```rust
pub mod mod1;
pub mod mod2;
```

* sub_modules/mod1.rs

```rust
pub fn foo() {
	println!("Im in multiple module 1");
}
```

* sub_modules/mod2.rs
  
  ```rust
  pub fn foo() {
	println!("Im in multiple module 2");
}
```
