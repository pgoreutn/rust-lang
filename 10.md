# Error Handling

Rust has a number of features for handling situations in which something goes wrong.
Rust groups errors into two major categories: **recoverable** and **unrecoverable** errors. 
Rust has the type Result<T, E> for recoverable errors and the panic! macro that stops execution when the program encounters an unrecoverable error. 

## Unrecoverable Errors with panic!

Sometimes, bad things happen in your code, and there’s nothing you can do about it. In these cases, Rust has the panic! macro. 

```Rust
 fn main() {
    panic!("crash and burn");
}
```
When you run the program, you’ll see something like this:

```
$ cargo run
  Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
   Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25 secs
    Running 'target/debug/panic'
thread 'main' panicked at 'crash and burn', src/main.rs:2:5
note: Run with 'RUST_BACKTRACE=1' for a backtrace.
```

### Using a panic! Backtrace

```Rust
src/main.rs
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3];

    v[99];
}
```

## Recoverable Errors with Result

Sometimes, when a function fails, it’s for a reason that you can easily interpret and respond to. For example, if you try to open a file and that operation fails because the file doesn’t exist, you might want to create the file instead of terminating the process.

Recall from “Handling Potential Failure with the Result Type” , that the Result enum is defined as having two variants, Ok and Err, as follows:

```Rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```

The T and E are generic type parameters: 
Let’s call a function that returns a Result value because the function could fail.

```Rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt");
}
```

How do we know File::open returns a Result? We could look at the standard library API documentation, or we could ask the compiler! 
The error message will then tell us what the type of f is.

```Rust
let f: u32 = File::open("hello.txt");
```

Attempting to compile now gives us the following output:

```
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:4:18
  |
4 |     let f: u32 = File::open("hello.txt");
  |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected u32, found enum
`std::result::Result`
  |
  = note: expected type `u32`
             found type `std::result::Result<std::fs::File, std::io::Error>`

```

This tells us the return type of the File::open function is a Result<T, E>. The generic parameter T has been filled in here with the type of the success value, std::fs::File, which is a file handle. 


This return type means the call to File::open might succeed and return a file handle that we can read from or write to. The function call also might fail: for example, the file might not exist, or we might not have permission to access the file. The File::open function needs to have a way to tell us whether it succeeded or failed and at the same time give us either the file handle or error information. This information is exactly what the Result enum conveys.

In the case where File::open succeeds, the value in the variable f will be an instance of Ok that contains a file handle. In the case where it fails, the value in f will be an instance of Err that contains more information about the kind of error that happened.

```Rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt");
    let f = match f {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => {
           panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", error)
        },
    };
}
```

 the Result enum and its variants have been brought into scope by the prelude, so we don’t need to specify Result:: before the Ok and Err variants in the match arms.

 ### Matching on Different Errors

What we want to do instead is take different actions for different failure reasons: if File::open failed because the file doesn’t exist, we want to create the file and return the handle to the new file. If File::open failed for any other reason

```Rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt");

    let f = match f {
        Ok(file) => file,
        Err(error) => match error.kind() {
            ErrorKind::NotFound => match File::create("hello.txt") {
                Ok(fc) => fc,
                Err(e) => panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", e),
            },
            other_error => panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", other_error),
        },
    };
}
```

That’s a lot of match! the Result<T, E> type has many methods that accept a closure and are implemented using match expressions. Using those methods will make your code more concise. 

```Rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::ErrorKind;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
        if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
            File::create("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                panic!("Problem creating the file: {:?}", error);
            })
        } else {
            panic!("Problem opening the file: {:?}", error);
        }
    });
}
```

### Shortcuts for Panic on Error: unwrap and expect

Using match works well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and doesn’t always communicate intent well. The Result<T, E> type has many helper methods defined on it to do various tasks. 

 If the Result value is the Ok variant, unwrap will return the value inside the Ok. If the Result is the Err variant, unwrap will call the panic! macro for us. 

 ```Rust
 use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap();
}

```
expect, which is similar to unwrap, lets us also choose the panic! error message. 

```Rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt").expect("Failed to open hello.txt");
}
```

If we run this code without a hello.txt file, we’ll see an error message from the panic! call that the unwrap method makes:
```
thread 'main' panicked at 'called 'Result::unwrap()' on an 'Err' value: Error
{ repr: Os { code: 2, message: "No such file or directory" } }', /src/libcore/
result.rs:906:4
```

Another method, expect, which is similar to unwrap, lets us also choose the panic! error message.

```Rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt").expect("Failed to open hello.txt");
}
```
We use expect in the same way as unwrap: to return the file handle or call the panic! macro

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'Failed to open hello.txt: Error { repr: Os { code:
2, message: "No such file or directory" } }', /src/libcore/result.rs:906:4
```

### Propagating Errors

When you’re writing a function whose implementation calls something that might fail, instead of handling the error within this function, you can return the error to the calling code so that it can decide what to do. 

For example , if the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read, this function will return those errors to the code that called this function.

```Rust
 use std::io;
use std::io::Read;
use std::fs::File;

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let f = File::open("hello.txt");

    let mut f = match f {
       Ok(file) => file,
       Err(e) => return Err(e),
    };

    let mut s = String::new();
    match f.read_to_string(&mut s){
       Ok(_) => Ok(s),
       Err(e) => Err(e),
   }
}

```

### A Shortcut for Propagating Errors: the ? Operator

Shows an implementation of read_username_from_file , but this implementation uses the ? operator.
```Rust
 use std::io;
use std::io::Read;
use std::fs::File;

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut f = File::open("hello.txt")?;
    let mut s = String::new();
    f.read_to_string(&mut s)?;
    Ok(s)
}
```
 If the value of the Result is an Ok, the value inside the Ok will get returned from this expression, and the program will continue. If the value is an Err, the Err will be returned from the whole function as if we had used the return keyword so the error value gets propagated to the calling code.

When the ? operator calls the from function, the error type received is converted into the error type defined in the return type of the current function. 

The ? at the end of the File::open call will return the value inside an Ok to the variable f. If an error occurs, the ? operator will return early out of the whole function and give any Err value to the calling code. 

We could even shorten this code further by chaining method calls immediately after the ?

```Rust
use std::io;
use std::io::Read;
use std::fs::File;

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut s = String::new();

    File::open("hello.txt")?.read_to_string(&mut s)?;

    Ok(s)
}
```
We still have a ? at the end of the read_to_string call, and we still return an Ok value containing the username in s when both File::open and read_to_string succeed rather than returning errors. 

### The? Operator Can Only Be Used in Functions That Return Result

The ? operator can only be used in functions that have a return type of Result, because it is defined to work in the same way as the match expression we defined . The part of the match that requires a return type of Result is return Err(e), so the return type of the function must be a Result to be compatible with this return.
