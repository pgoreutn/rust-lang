# The Slice Type

Slices let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection.

```Text
write a function that takes a string and returns the first word it finds in that string. If the function doesn’t find a space in the string, the whole string must be one word, so the entire string should be returned.
```


```Rustfn main(){
    let mut s = String::from("Hello World");

    let word = first_word(&s);
    s.clear()

}


fn first_word(s:&String) -> usize {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    for(i,&item) in bytes.iter().enumerate(){
        if item==b' '{
            return i
        }
    }
    s.len()
}
```

## String Slices

A string slice is a reference to part of a String, and it looks like this:

```Rust
let s = String::from("hello world");

  let hello = &s[0..5];
  let world = &s[6..11];
```

We can create slices using a range within brackets by specifying [starting_index..ending_index], where starting_index is the first position in the slice and ending_index is one more than the last position in the slice.
world would be a slice that contains a pointer to the 7th byte of s with a length value of 5.

With Rust’s .. range syntax, if you want to start at the first index (zero), you can drop the value before the two periods. In other words, these are equal:

```Rust
let s = String::from("hello");

let slice = &s[0..2];
let slice = &s[..2];
```

 if your slice includes the last byte of the String, you can drop the trailing number. 

 ```Rust
 let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[3..len];
let slice = &s[3..];
```


You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string.

```Rust
let s = String::from("hello");

let len = s.len();

let slice = &s[0..len];
let slice = &s[..];

```

let’s rewrite first_word to return a slice. 

```Rust
fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();

    for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
         if item == b' ' {
             return &s[0..i];
         }
    }

    &s[..]
}

```
