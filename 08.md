# Enums and Pattern Matching

## Defining an Enum

Say we need to work with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses: version four and version six. We can enumerate all possible values, which is where enumeration gets its name.

We can express this concept in code by defining an IpAddrKind enumeration and listing the possible kinds an IP address can be, V4 and V6.

```Rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
```

IpAddrKind is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.

## Enum Values

We can create instances of each of the two variants of IpAddrKind like this:

```Rust
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```

At the moment we don’t have a way to store the actual IP address data; we only know what kind it is.

```Rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,

}

struct IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind,
    address: String,
}

let home = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
    address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
};

let loopback = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
    address: String::from("::1"),
};
```

 We’ve used a struct to bundle the kind and address values together, so now the variant is associated with the value.

 We can represent the same concept in a more concise way using just an enum, rather than an enum inside a struct, by putting data directly into each enum variant.

 ```Rust
 enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),

}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

If we wanted to store V4 addresses as four u8 values but still express V6 addresses as one String value, we wouldn’t be able to with a struct. Enums handle this case with ease.

```Rust
enum IpAddr {    
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),    
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

Let’s look at another example of an enum , this one has a wide variety of types embedded in its variants.

```Rust
enum Message {
        Quit,    
        Move { x: i32, y: i32 },    
        Write(String),    
        ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we’re able to define methods on structs using impl, we’re also able to define methods on enums.

```Rust
impl Message {
    fn call(&self) {
        // method body would be defined here       
    }
}
let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));   m.call();
```

## The Option Enum and Its Advantages over Null Values

Option , is another enum defined by the standard library. The Option type is used in many places because it encodes the very common scenario in which a value could be something or it could be nothing. 

This functionality can prevent bugs that are extremely common in other programming languages.
Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is Option<T>, and it is defined by the standard library as follows:

```Rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

The Option<T> enum is so useful that it’s even included in the prelude.
In addition, so are its variants: you can use Some and None directly without the Option:: prefix. The Option<T> enum is still just a regular enum, and Some(T) and None are still variants of type Option<T>.

```Rust
let some_number = Some(5);
let some_string = Some("a string");

let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
```

If we use None rather than Some, we need to tell Rust what type of Option<T> we have, because the compiler can’t infer the type that the Some variant will hold by looking only at a None value.

## The Match Control Flow Operator

Rust has an extremely powerful control flow operator called match that allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute code based on which pattern matches. 

We can write a function that can take an unknown United States coin and, in a similar way as the counting machine, determine which coin it is and return its value in cents, as shown here

```Rust
num Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,

    }
}
```

## Patterns That Bind to Values

Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the values that match the pattern.

```Rust
#[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
enum UsState {
    Alabama,
    Alaska,
    // --snip--
}

enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter(UsState),
}
```
In the match expression for this code, we add a variable called state to the pattern that matches values of the variant Coin::Quarter. When a Coin::Quarter matches, the state variable will bind to the value of that quarter’s state.

```Rust
fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter(state) => {
            println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
            25
        },
    }
}
```

## Matching with Option<T>

We can also handle Option<T> using match as we did with the Coin enum! Instead of comparing coins, we’ll compare the variants of Option<T>

```Rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        None => None,
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}

let five = Some(5);
let six = plus_one(five);
let none = plus_one(None); 
```

## Matches Are Exhaustive

Consider this version of our plus_one function that has a bug and won’t compile:

```Rust
fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
    match x {
        Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
    }
}
```
We didn’t handle the None case, so this code will cause a bug.

```
error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns: `None` not covered
 -->
  |
6 |         match x {
  |               ^ pattern `None` not covered
```

Rust knows that we didn’t cover every possible case and even knows which pattern we forgot! 

## The _ Placeholder

Rust also has a pattern we can use when we don’t want to list all possible values. 

```Rust
let some_u8_value = 0u8;
match some_u8_value {
    1 => println!("one"),
    3 => println!("three"),
    5 => println!("five"),
    7 => println!("seven"),
    _ => (),
}
```

The _ pattern will match any value. By putting it after our other arms, the _ will match all the possible cases that aren’t specified before it. The () is just the unit value, so nothing will happen in the _ case.

However, the match expression can be a bit wordy in a situation in which we care about only one of the cases. For this situation, Rust provides if let.

## Concise control flow with if let

The if let syntax lets you combine if and let into a less verbose way to handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider the program that matches on an Option<u8> value but only wants to execute code if the value is 3.

```Rust
if let Some(3) = some_u8_value {
    println!("three");
}
```

you lose the exhaustive checking that match enforces. Choosing between match and if let depends on what you’re doing in your particular situation and whether gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive checking.

```Rust
let mut count = 0;
match coin {
    Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state),
    _ => count += 1,
}

```

Or we could use an if let and else expression like this:

```Rust
let mut count = 0;
if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
    println!("State quarter from {:?}!", state);
} else {
    count += 1;
}
```
