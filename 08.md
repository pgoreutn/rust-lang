# Enums and Pattern Matching

## Defining an Enum

Say we need to work with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses: version four and version six. We can enumerate all possible values, which is where enumeration gets its name.

We can express this concept in code by defining an IpAddrKind enumeration and listing the possible kinds an IP address can be, V4 and V6.

```Rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
```

IpAddrKind is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.

## Enum Values

We can create instances of each of the two variants of IpAddrKind like this:

```Rust
let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```

At the moment we don’t have a way to store the actual IP address data; we only know what kind it is.

```Rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,

}

struct IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind,
    address: String,
}

let home = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
    address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
};

let loopback = IpAddr {
    kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
    address: String::from("::1"),
};
```

 We’ve used a struct to bundle the kind and address values together, so now the variant is associated with the value.

 We can represent the same concept in a more concise way using just an enum, rather than an enum inside a struct, by putting data directly into each enum variant.

 ```Rust
 enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String),

}

let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));

let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

If we wanted to store V4 addresses as four u8 values but still express V6 addresses as one String value, we wouldn’t be able to with a struct. Enums handle this case with ease.

```Rust
enum IpAddr {    
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),    
    V6(String),
}

let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```

Let’s look at another example of an enum , this one has a wide variety of types embedded in its variants.

```Rust
enum Message {
        Quit,    
        Move { x: i32, y: i32 },    
        Write(String),    
        ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

There is one more similarity between enums and structs: just as we’re able to define methods on structs using impl, we’re also able to define methods on enums.

```Rust
impl Message {
    fn call(&self) {
        // method body would be defined here       
    }
}
let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));   m.call();
```

## The Option Enum and Its Advantages over Null Values

Option , is another enum defined by the standard library. The Option type is used in many places because it encodes the very common scenario in which a value could be something or it could be nothing. 

this functionality can prevent bugs that are extremely common in other programming languages.
