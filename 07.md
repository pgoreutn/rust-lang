# Defining and instantiating structs
To define a struct, we enter the keyword struct and name the entire struct.

```Rust
struct User {
    username: String,
    email: String,
    sign_in_count: u64,
    active: bool,
}
```

To use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an instance of that struct by specifying concrete values for each of the fields. 
In other words, the struct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill in that template with particular data to create values of the type. 

```Rust
let user1 = User {
    email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
    username: String::from("someusername123"),
    active: true,
    sign_in_count: 1,
};
```

To get a specific value from a struct, we can use dot notation. If we wanted just this user’s email address, we could use user1.email wherever we wanted to use this value. 

```Rust
user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
```

Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark only certain fields as mutable. 
build_user function that returns a User instance with the given email and username. The active field gets a value of true, and the sign_in_count gets a value of 1.

```Rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email: email,
        username: username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

## Using the Field Init Shorthand When Variables and Fields Have the Same Name

Because the parameter names and the struct field names are exactly the same , we can use the field init shorthand syntax to rewrite build_user

```Rust
fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
    User {
        email,
        username,
        active: true,
        sign_in_count: 1,
    }
}
```

## Creating Instances from Other Instances with Struct Update Syntax

It’s often useful to create a new instance of a struct that uses most of an old instance’s values but changes some. You’ll do this using struct update syntax.

```Rust
let user1 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
    active: user1.active,
    sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
};
```

Creating a new User instance using some of the values from user1
specifies that the remaining fields not explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.

```Rust
let user2 = User {
    email: String::from("another@example.com"),
    username: String::from("anotherusername567"),
    ..user1
};
```

## Adding Useful Functionality with Derived Traits

It’d be nice to be able to print an instance of Rectangle while we’re debugging our program and see the values for all its fields.
This won’t work, however.

```Rust
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };
    println!("rect1 is {}", rect1);
}

error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`

```

The Debug trait enables us to print our struct in a way that is useful for developers so we can see its value while we’re debugging our code.

```Rust
 #[derive(Debug)]
struct Rectangle {
    width: u32,
    height: u32,

}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };

    println!("rect1 is {:?}", rect1);
}

```

Adding the annotation to derive the Debug trait and printing the Rectangle instance using debug formatting

```Text
rect1 is Rectangle {width: 30, height: 50 }
```

## Method Syntax

Methods are different from functions in that they’re defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait object) , and their first parameter is always self, which represents the instance of the struct the method is being called on.

### Defining Methods

```Rust
 #[derive(Debug)]
   struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
   }
   
impl Rectangle {
    fn area(&self) -> u32 {
        self.width * self.height
    }   
}

fn main() {
    let rect1 = Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 };

    println!("The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",rect1.area());
}
```

## Associated Functions

Another useful feature of impl blocks is that we’re allowed to define functions within impl blocks that don’t take self as a parameter. These are called associated functions because they’re associated with the struct. They’re still functions, not methods, because they don’t have an instance of the struct to work with. You’ve already used the String::from associated function.

```Rust
impl Rectangle {
    fn square(size: u32) -> Rectangle {
        Rectangle { width: size, height: size }

    }

}
```

To call this associated function, we use the :: syntax with the struct name; 

```Rust
    let sq = Rectangle::square(3); 
```
